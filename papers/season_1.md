## Episode 1: GenCast- Probabilistic Weather Forecasting with Machine Learning

- **DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08252-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08252-9)

**Abstract:**  
Weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, so predicting the range of probable weather scenarios is crucial for important decisions, from warning the public about hazardous weather to planning renewable energy use. Traditionally, weather forecasts have been based on numerical weather prediction (NWP), which relies on physics-based simulations of the atmosphere. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based weather prediction (MLWP) have produced ML-based models with less forecast error than single NWP simulations. However, these advances have focused primarily on single, deterministic forecasts that fail to represent uncertainty and estimate risk...

## Episode 15: Advances in Land Surface Model-Based Forecasting

- **DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2081](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2081)

**Abstract:**
Most useful weather prediction for the public is near the surface. The processes that are most relevant for near-surface weather prediction are also those that are most interactive and exhibit positive feedback or have key role in energy partitioning. Land surface models (LSMs) consider these processes together with surface heterogeneity and forecast water, carbon and energy fluxes, and coupled with an atmospheric model provide boundary and initial conditions.

## Episode 18: GRAPHDOP — Towards Skillful Data-Driven Medium-Range Weather Forecasts

- **DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.15687](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.15687)

**Abstract:**
We introduce GraphDOP, a new data-driven, end-to-end forecast system developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) that is trained and initialised exclusively from Earth System observations, with no physics-based (re)analysis inputs or feedbacks. GraphDOP learns the correlations between observed quantities - such as brightness temperatures from polar orbiters and geostationary satellites - and geophysical quantities of interest (that are measured by conventional observations), to form a coherent latent representation of Earth System state dynamics and physical processes, and is capable of producing skilful predictions of relevant weather parameters up to five days into the future.

**Bullet points summary:**
GraphDOP is a new data-driven forecast system developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) that learns and initialises directly from Earth System observations, without relying on physics-based (re)analysis inputs or feedbacks.
GraphDOP is capable of producing skillful forecasts of surface and upper-air weather parameters up to five days into the future. For two-metre temperature (t2m) forecasts, GraphDOP is competitive with the operational IFS system and has smaller t2m forecast departures than IFS over the Tropics at lead times of 5 days.
The model can produce forecasts of observations at arbitrary time and space locations, even for observation types with sparse coverage, and does not require gridded ERA5 fields during training.
GraphDOP demonstrates the ability to combine information from different instruments to produce a skillful joint forecast of surface and lower tropospheric temperature over the Tropics.
The network learns relationships between observed variables that generalise to areas without observations. For example, forecasts of upper-level winds compare well with ERA5 even in areas lacking radiosonde or aircraft coverage

**Bullet points summary:**
Pangu-Weather, an AI-based weather forecasting system, uses 3D deep networks with Earth-specific priors to achieve accurate medium-range global weather forecasts.
Pangu-Weather uses a hierarchical temporal aggregation strategy to reduce accumulation errors in medium-range forecasting.
Pangu-Weather demonstrates stronger deterministic forecast results compared to the operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) on tested weather variables. It also shows improved accuracy in tracking tropical cyclones compared to ECMWF-HRES.
The AI-based method of Pangu-Weather is more than 10,000 times faster than the operational IFS, offering opportunities for large-member ensemble forecasts with reduced computational costs.
Pangu-Weather was trained and tested on reanalysis data and showed limitations, such as omitting certain weather variables and producing smoother forecast results. However, it shows the potential for combining AI-based and NWP methods for improved performance.

## Episode 20: Finding the Right XAI Method—A Guide for the Evaluation and Ranking of Explainable AI Methods in Climate Science

- **DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.00652](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.00652)

**Abstract:**
Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods shed light on the predictions of machine learning algorithms. Several different approaches exist and have already been applied in climate science. However, usually missing ground truth explanations complicate their evaluation and comparison, subsequently impeding the choice of the XAI method. Therefore, in this work, we introduce XAI evaluation in the climate context and discuss different desired explanation properties, namely robustness, faithfulness, randomization, complexity, and localization....

**Bullet points summary:**
XAI evaluation is introduced to climate science to compare and assess the performance of explanation methods based on desirable properties, which can help climate researchers choose suitable XAI methods.
The paper identifies and discusses five desirable properties of XAI methods: robustness, faithfulness, randomization, complexity, and localization. These properties are evaluated in the context of climate science using an established classification task.
Different XAI methods exhibit varying strengths and weaknesses with respect to the five evaluation properties, and their performance can be architecture-dependent. For example, salience methods tend to show improvements in faithfulness and complexity but reduced randomization skill. Sensitivity methods, on the other hand, tend to have higher randomization skill scores, but sacrifice faithfulness and complexity skills.
The paper proposes a framework for selecting an appropriate XAI method for a specific research task. This framework involves identifying essential XAI properties, calculating evaluation skill scores across these properties for different XAI methods, and then ranking or comparing the skill scores to determine the best-performing method or combination of methods.
XAI evaluation can support researchers in choosing an explanation method, independent of the network structure and targeted to their specific research problem. The use of evaluation metrics alongside benchmark datasets contributes to the benchmarking of explanation methods.
