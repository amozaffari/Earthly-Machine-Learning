## Episode 1: GenCast- Probabilistic Weather Forecasting with Machine Learning

- **DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08252-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08252-9)

**Abstract:**  
Weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, so predicting the range of probable weather scenarios is crucial for important decisions, from warning the public about hazardous weather to planning renewable energy use. Traditionally, weather forecasts have been based on numerical weather prediction (NWP), which relies on physics-based simulations of the atmosphere. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based weather prediction (MLWP) have produced ML-based models with less forecast error than single NWP simulations. However, these advances have focused primarily on single, deterministic forecasts that fail to represent uncertainty and estimate risk...

We introduce GraphDOP, a new data-driven, end-to-end forecast system developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) that is trained and initialised exclusively from Earth System observations, with no physics-based (re)analysis inputs or feedbacks. GraphDOP learns the correlations between observed quantities - such as brightness temperatures from polar orbiters and geostationary satellites - and geophysical quantities of interest (that are measured by conventional observations), to form a coherent latent representation of Earth System state dynamics and physical processes, and is capable of producing skilful predictions of relevant weather parameters up to five days into the future.

**Bullet points summary:**
GraphDOP is a new data-driven forecast system developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) that learns and initialises directly from Earth System observations, without relying on physics-based (re)analysis inputs or feedbacks.
GraphDOP is capable of producing skillful forecasts of surface and upper-air weather parameters up to five days into the future. For two-metre temperature (t2m) forecasts, GraphDOP is competitive with the operational IFS system and has smaller t2m forecast departures than IFS over the Tropics at lead times of 5 days.
The model can produce forecasts of observations at arbitrary time and space locations, even for observation types with sparse coverage, and does not require gridded ERA5 fields during training.
GraphDOP demonstrates the ability to combine information from different instruments to produce a skillful joint forecast of surface and lower tropospheric temperature over the Tropics.
The network learns relationships between observed variables that generalise to areas without observations. For example, forecasts of upper-level winds compare well with ERA5 even in areas lacking radiosonde or aircraft coverage

## Episode 20: Finding the Right XAI Method—A Guide for the Evaluation and Ranking of Explainable AI Methods in Climate Science

- **DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.00652](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.00652)

**Abstract:**
Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods shed light on the predictions of machine learning algorithms. Several different approaches exist and have already been applied in climate science. However, usually missing ground truth explanations complicate their evaluation and comparison, subsequently impeding the choice of the XAI method. Therefore, in this work, we introduce XAI evaluation in the climate context and discuss different desired explanation properties, namely robustness, faithfulness, randomization, complexity, and localization....

**Bullet points summary:**
XAI evaluation is introduced to climate science to compare and assess the performance of explanation methods based on desirable properties, which can help climate researchers choose suitable XAI methods.
The paper identifies and discusses five desirable properties of XAI methods: robustness, faithfulness, randomization, complexity, and localization. These properties are evaluated in the context of climate science using an established classification task.
Different XAI methods exhibit varying strengths and weaknesses with respect to the five evaluation properties, and their performance can be architecture-dependent. For example, salience methods tend to show improvements in faithfulness and complexity but reduced randomization skill. Sensitivity methods, on the other hand, tend to have higher randomization skill scores, but sacrifice faithfulness and complexity skills.
The paper proposes a framework for selecting an appropriate XAI method for a specific research task. This framework involves identifying essential XAI properties, calculating evaluation skill scores across these properties for different XAI methods, and then ranking or comparing the skill scores to determine the best-performing method or combination of methods.
XAI evaluation can support researchers in choosing an explanation method, independent of the network structure and targeted to their specific research problem. The use of evaluation metrics alongside benchmark datasets contributes to the benchmarking of explanation methods.

**Abstract:**
Accurate and cost-effective quantification of the carbon cycle for agroecosystems at decision-relevant scales is critical to mitigating climate change and ensuring sustainable food production. However, conventional process-based or data-driven modeling approaches alone have large prediction uncertainties due to the complex biogeochemical processes to model and the lack of observations to constrain many key state and flux variables. Here we propose a Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML) framework that addresses the above challenges by integrating knowledge embedded in a process-based model, high-resolution remote sensing observations, and machine learning (ML) techniques. .....

**Bullet points summary:**

It also shows **greater robustness with limited real-world training data** compared to pure machine learning models.
- The framework provides **high-resolution (250m daily) estimates of key carbon budget components**, including gross primary production (GPP), autotrophic respiration (Ra), heterotrophic respiration (Rh), net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), and crop yield, offering a novel product for precise regional-scale carbon budget quantification down to individual fields.
- Key factors contributing to the improved performance of KGML-ag-Carbon include **pre-training with synthetic data generated by the process-based model and the assimilation of remotely sensed GPP data**. The hierarchical structure and knowledge-guided loss functions also contribute to capturing complex carbon flux dynamics and the interpretability of predictions.
- The KGML-ag-Carbon framework has **potential for transferability to other applications**, such as predicting other nutrient cycles, estimating carbon outcomes over larger regions and in different ecosystems, and assessing the impacts of various management practices and extreme weather events. Its high computational efficiency compared to the underlying process-based model enables large-scale, high-resolution assessments.

This significant acceleration is evident in its much quicker training time and inference speed.
- The model's performance is attributed to its **Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (AFNO) architecture**, which is adept at processing high-resolution data and demonstrates superior scaling properties compared to conventional vision transformers when applied to weather and climate data. FourCastNet employs techniques such as model and data parallelism, spectral convolution using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), and optimisations like CUDA graphs and JIT compilation to ensure efficient operation on supercomputing systems.
- **FourCastNet exhibits excellent scalability on large-scale supercomputing systems**, including Selene, Perlmutter, and JUWELS Booster, reaching up to 140.8 petaFLOPS. This scalability allows for faster training of larger models, considerably reducing the time-to-solution for weather forecasting. Furthermore, the rapid inference capability enables the generation of extensive ensemble forecasts, which could lead to improved predictions of rare and extreme weather events.
- The development of FourCastNet has profound **implications for weather and climate science**, offering potential solutions to key challenges such as the complexity, resolution, ensemble size, and throughput limitations inherent in traditional NWP methods. It opens up possibilities for emulating the entire Earth system, resolving fine-scale processes, and producing predictions at unprecedented speeds, which can help alleviate the "data avalanche" associated with exascale computing.
- FourCastNet signifies a step towards **"Interactivity at Scale" and the creation of digital twins of Earth**, empowering scientists, policymakers, and the wider society with the ability to access, interact with, and understand potential future climate scenarios. This advancement in weather and climate prediction can facilitate better-informed decision-making and further drive climate action.

Earth system models have been continously improved over the past decades, but systematic errors compared with observations and uncertainties in climate projections remain. This is due mainly to the imperfect representation of subgrid-scale or unknown processes. Here we propose a next-generation Earth system modelling approach with artificial intelligence that calls for accelerated models, machine-learning integration, systematic use of Earth observations and modernized infrastructures….

This involves using kilometre-scale models alongside improved coarser-resolution hybrid ESMs that incorporate essential Earth system processes and feedbacks.
- This **AI-empowered multiscale approach** rests on four key pillars: **achieving higher resolution with new computing technologies, enhancing hybrid ESMs with physics-aware machine learning (ML), systematically using Earth observations to constrain and improve models, and establishing modern, operational science infrastructures**.
- The expected outcomes of this synergistic approach include **faster and more accurate delivery of policy-relevant climate information**, which is crucial for addressing urgent mitigation and adaptation needs in a rapidly changing world.
- The vision includes developing **hybrid ESMs where ML enhances the representation of subgrid-scale processes and Earth system feedbacks**, alongside the operationalisation of policy-relevant climate simulations and the creation of more realistic and interactive digital twins of the Earth system.

## Episode 25: **ClimaX: A foundation model for weather and climate**

- **DOI:** https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2301.10343

**Abstract:**

Most state-of-the-art approaches for weather and climate modeling are based on physics-informed numerical models of the atmosphere. These approaches aim to model the non-linear dynamics and complex interactions between multiple variables, which are challenging to approximate. Additionally, many such numerical models are computationally intensive, especially when modeling the atmospheric phenomenon at a fine-grained spatial and temporal resolution. Recent data-driven approaches based on machine learning instead aim to directly solve a downstream forecasting or projection task by learning a data-driven functional mapping using deep neural networks. However, these networks are trained using curated and homogeneous climate datasets for specific spatiotemporal tasks, and thus lack the generality of numerical models. We develop and demonstrate ClimaX, a flexible and generalizable deep learning model for weather and climate science that can be trained using heterogeneous datasets spanning different variables, spatio-temporal coverage, and physical groundings…..

**Bullet points summary:**

## Episode 26: **Climate-invariant machine learning**

- **DOI:** [DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adj7250](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adj7250)

**Abstract:**

Projecting climate change is a generalization problem: We extrapolate the recent past using physical models across past, present, and future climates. Current climate models require representations of processes that occur at scales smaller than model grid size, which have been the main source of model projection uncertainty. Recent machine learning (ML) algorithms hold promise to improve such process representations but tend to extrapolate poorly to climate regimes that they were not trained on. To get the best of the physical and statistical worlds, we propose a framework, termed “climate-invariant” ML, incorporating knowledge of climate processes into ML algorithms, and show that ….

**Bullet points summary:**

- The paper addresses the challenge of machine learning (ML) algorithms in climate science that often **fail to extrapolate accurately to climate conditions outside of their training data range**. This limitation hinders their use in projecting future climate change.
- To overcome this, the authors propose a **"climate-invariant" ML framework** that incorporates knowledge of climate processes into ML algorithms**1**. This is achieved by applying physically based feature transformations to the input and output data, aiming to make their distributions more consistent across different climates.
- The study demonstrates that these **climate-invariant ML models, particularly neural networks (NNs), maintain high accuracy and generalise significantly better across a wide range of climate conditions and configurations** in three distinct atmospheric models compared to raw-data ML models. The incremental transformation of inputs like specific humidity, temperature, and latent heat flux progressively improves generalisation abilities.
- Explainable artificial intelligence techniques suggest that **climate-invariant mappings learned by NNs are more spatially local**, indicating that incorporating physical knowledge leads to more robust and interpretable models. This approach also enhances data efficiency and performance, even when training data from multiple climates are available.

## Episode 27:  Fixing the Double Penalty in Data-Driven Weather Forecasting Through a Modified Spherical Harmonic Loss Function

- **DOI:** https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.19374

**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in data-driven weather forecasting models have delivered deterministic models that outperform the leading operational forecast systems based on traditional, physics-based models. However, these data-driven models are typically trained with a mean squared error loss function, which causes smoothing of fine scales through a "double penalty" effect. We develop a simple, parameter-free modification to this loss function that avoids this problem by separating the loss attributable to decorrelation from the loss attributable to spectral amplitude errors.

**Bullet points summary:**

- **Data-driven weather forecasting models, despite their high skill, typically produce overly smooth forecasts** due to training with a mean squared error (MSE) loss function. This "double penalty" effect causes an under-prediction of localized extreme events and reduces the effective resolution of models like GraphCast.
- The authors propose a **new, parameter-free loss function called Adjusted Mean Squared Error (AMSE)**. This function modifies the MSE by separating the loss attributable to decorrelation from the loss attributable to spectral amplitude errors, encouraging the model to reproduce a realistic spectrum even if it cannot make a perfectly accurate prediction.
- **Fine-tuning the GraphCast model with this new AMSE loss function significantly improves forecast sharpness and effective resolution**. This leads to an increase in effective resolution from 1,250km to 160km, improvements to ensemble spread, and more accurate predictions of tropical cyclone strength and surface wind extremes.
- This approach demonstrates that **it is possible to produce sharp, deterministic weather forecasts without directly modeling ensemble uncertainty**, making data-driven weather forecasting more realistic and useful for predicting extreme weather events.

- **DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-56573-8

**Abstract:**

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has deeply impacted various fields, including Earth system sciences, by improving weather forecasting, model emulation, parameter estimation, and the prediction of extreme events. The latter comes with specific challenges, such as developing accurate predictors from noisy, heterogeneous, small sample sizes and data with limited annotations. This paper reviews how AI is being used to analyze extreme climate events (like floods, droughts, wildfires, and heatwaves), highlighting the importance of creating accurate, transparent, and reliable AI models……

**Bullet points summary:**

- **Artificial intelligence (AI) is having a profound impact on Earth system sciences**, significantly enhancing capabilities for **modelling, detecting, forecasting, and assessing the impacts of extreme climate events** such as floods, droughts, wildfires, and heatwaves. AI also offers advances in attribution studies, explanation, and the generation of worst-case scenarios
- Despite its potential, **applying AI to extreme events faces significant challenges**. These include developing accurate predictors from noisy, heterogeneous, and small datasets, dealing with limited expert annotations, and overcoming the inherent difficulty of providing a precise, universally applicable statistical definition of an extreme event. Ensuring models capture complex, non-stationary relationships and perform robustly under unseen conditions are also key hurdles
- **Building trustworthy AI models is paramount** for high-stakes decisions related to public safety and resource allocation. This involves a focus on **transparency, reliability, and interpretability** through methods like Explainable AI (XAI), which helps to reveal model functioning, learned relationships, and biases, as well as causal inference to understand underlying mechanisms and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to assess prediction confidence
- The **"last mile" of AI integration focuses on operationalisation and effective risk communication** to translate AI-enhanced information into actionable insights for decision-makers and the public. This requires developing robust early warning systems, personalising alerts, and addressing ethical considerations such as fairness, privacy, and bias in AI models to ensure community preparedness and response
- **Cross-disciplinary collaboration is essential** for advancing AI applications in extreme event analysis. It necessitates a coordinated effort involving AI researchers, environmental and climate scientists, field experts, and policymakers to develop practical, understandable, and trustworthy AI solutions that are adapted to real-world needs and constraints, ultimately enhancing disaster readiness and risk reduction

## Episode 29:  **On Some Limitations of Current Machine Learning Weather Prediction Models**

- **DOI:**  https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL107377

**Abstract:**
Machine Learning (ML) is having a profound impact in the domain of Weather and Climate Prediction. A recent development in this area has been the emergence of fully data-driven ML prediction models which routinely claim superior performance to that of traditional physics-based models. We examine some aspects of the forecasts produced by three of the leading current ML models, Pangu-Weather, FourCastNet and GraphCast, with a focus on their fidelity and physical consistency....

**Bullet points summary:**

- Current machine learning (ML) weather prediction models, including Pangu-Weather, FourCastNet, and GraphCast, are unable to properly reproduce sub-synoptic and mesoscale weather phenomena, and they lack the fidelity and physical consistency of traditional physics-based models. Their forecasts tend to become progressively "blurry" or smoother with increasing forecast lead times.

- A significant issue is that forecasts from these ML models have energy spectra that are notably different from their training reanalysis fields and traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. This discrepancy means that weather phenomena at spatial scales shorter than 300–400 km are not accurately represented.

- The ML models do not realistically represent fundamental physical balances in the atmosphere. For instance, the balance between mass variables and the wind field (geostrophic wind balance) is compromised, and the ratio between divergent and rotational wind components is significantly reduced. This physical inconsistency impacts the realism of derived quantities, such as vertical motion fields and areas of active weather.

- Despite claims of superior performance and significantly lower computational costs during deployment compared to traditional NWP systems, these ML models are better considered as post-processing algorithms targeted at optimizing specific aspects of forecast performance (like medium-range mean squared/absolute errors). They are not general-purpose atmosphere simulators or "atmospheric digital twins," and their development and training still fundamentally depend on physics-based models and data assimilation systems

## Episode 30:  **Early warning of complex climate risk with integrated artificial intelligence**

- **DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57640-w

**Abstract:**
As climate change accelerates, human societies face growing exposure to disasters and stress, highlighting the urgent need for effective early warning systems (EWS). These systems monitor, assess, and communicate risks to support resilience and sustainable development, but challenges remain in hazard forecasting, risk communication, and decision-making. This perspective explores the transformative potential of integrated Artificial Intelligence (AI) modeling...

**Bullet points summary:**

- Early Warning Systems (EWS) are essential for managing climate and environmental hazards, yet current systems face significant challenges. These include limitations in forecasting accuracy for both rapid and slow-onset disasters, difficulties in predicting real-world impacts due to complex local environmental and societal variables, underutilization of diverse data sources, and issues with effectively communicating warnings to varied communities.

- Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly through integrated modeling and Foundation Models (FMs), offers a transformative solution for EWS. AI can significantly improve forecast accuracy, lead times, and resolution. It enables a shift from mere hazard prediction to impact-centric and localized warnings by leveraging diverse data, including traditional meteorological, geospatial, and socioeconomic data, as well as unconventional sources like social media.

- A key technological path forward involves developing Foundation Models (FMs) for meteorology, geospatial applications, and their combination, potentially integrating natural language processing for enhanced communication. These FMs can enable more intuitive warnings (e.g., photo-realistic images of affected areas) and interactive communication through chatbots, adapting messages to user needs and improving decision-making.

- The effective and equitable implementation of AI-based EWS requires addressing critical challenges. These include mitigating biases in training data, ensuring robustness against unprecedented climate events, and navigating issues of data ownership and potential power centralization within a few entities, particularly private corporations. Emphasizing responsible AI practices guided by Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Ethics, and Sustainability (FATES) principles, promoting open-source models, fostering global collaboration, and addressing the digital divide are crucial for democratizing access and building trust.
