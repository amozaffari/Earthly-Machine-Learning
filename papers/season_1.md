## Episode 1: GenCast- Probabilistic Weather Forecasting with Machine Learning

- **DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08252-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08252-9)

**Abstract:**  
Weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, so predicting the range of probable weather scenarios is crucial for important decisions, from warning the public about hazardous weather to planning renewable energy use. Traditionally, weather forecasts have been based on numerical weather prediction (NWP), which relies on physics-based simulations of the atmosphere. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based weather prediction (MLWP) have produced ML-based models with less forecast error than single NWP simulations. However, these advances have focused primarily on single, deterministic forecasts that fail to represent uncertainty and estimate risk...

We introduce GraphDOP, a new data-driven, end-to-end forecast system developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) that is trained and initialised exclusively from Earth System observations, with no physics-based (re)analysis inputs or feedbacks. GraphDOP learns the correlations between observed quantities - such as brightness temperatures from polar orbiters and geostationary satellites - and geophysical quantities of interest (that are measured by conventional observations), to form a coherent latent representation of Earth System state dynamics and physical processes, and is capable of producing skilful predictions of relevant weather parameters up to five days into the future.

**Bullet points summary:**
GraphDOP is a new data-driven forecast system developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) that learns and initialises directly from Earth System observations, without relying on physics-based (re)analysis inputs or feedbacks.
GraphDOP is capable of producing skillful forecasts of surface and upper-air weather parameters up to five days into the future. For two-metre temperature (t2m) forecasts, GraphDOP is competitive with the operational IFS system and has smaller t2m forecast departures than IFS over the Tropics at lead times of 5 days.
The model can produce forecasts of observations at arbitrary time and space locations, even for observation types with sparse coverage, and does not require gridded ERA5 fields during training.
GraphDOP demonstrates the ability to combine information from different instruments to produce a skillful joint forecast of surface and lower tropospheric temperature over the Tropics.
The network learns relationships between observed variables that generalise to areas without observations. For example, forecasts of upper-level winds compare well with ERA5 even in areas lacking radiosonde or aircraft coverage

## Episode 20: Finding the Right XAI Method—A Guide for the Evaluation and Ranking of Explainable AI Methods in Climate Science

- **DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.00652](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.00652)

**Abstract:**
Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods shed light on the predictions of machine learning algorithms. Several different approaches exist and have already been applied in climate science. However, usually missing ground truth explanations complicate their evaluation and comparison, subsequently impeding the choice of the XAI method. Therefore, in this work, we introduce XAI evaluation in the climate context and discuss different desired explanation properties, namely robustness, faithfulness, randomization, complexity, and localization....

**Bullet points summary:**
XAI evaluation is introduced to climate science to compare and assess the performance of explanation methods based on desirable properties, which can help climate researchers choose suitable XAI methods.
The paper identifies and discusses five desirable properties of XAI methods: robustness, faithfulness, randomization, complexity, and localization. These properties are evaluated in the context of climate science using an established classification task.
Different XAI methods exhibit varying strengths and weaknesses with respect to the five evaluation properties, and their performance can be architecture-dependent. For example, salience methods tend to show improvements in faithfulness and complexity but reduced randomization skill. Sensitivity methods, on the other hand, tend to have higher randomization skill scores, but sacrifice faithfulness and complexity skills.
The paper proposes a framework for selecting an appropriate XAI method for a specific research task. This framework involves identifying essential XAI properties, calculating evaluation skill scores across these properties for different XAI methods, and then ranking or comparing the skill scores to determine the best-performing method or combination of methods.
XAI evaluation can support researchers in choosing an explanation method, independent of the network structure and targeted to their specific research problem. The use of evaluation metrics alongside benchmark datasets contributes to the benchmarking of explanation methods.

**Abstract:**
Accurate and cost-effective quantification of the carbon cycle for agroecosystems at decision-relevant scales is critical to mitigating climate change and ensuring sustainable food production. However, conventional process-based or data-driven modeling approaches alone have large prediction uncertainties due to the complex biogeochemical processes to model and the lack of observations to constrain many key state and flux variables. Here we propose a Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML) framework that addresses the above challenges by integrating knowledge embedded in a process-based model, high-resolution remote sensing observations, and machine learning (ML) techniques. .....

**Bullet points summary:**

It also shows **greater robustness with limited real-world training data** compared to pure machine learning models.
- The framework provides **high-resolution (250m daily) estimates of key carbon budget components**, including gross primary production (GPP), autotrophic respiration (Ra), heterotrophic respiration (Rh), net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), and crop yield, offering a novel product for precise regional-scale carbon budget quantification down to individual fields.
- Key factors contributing to the improved performance of KGML-ag-Carbon include **pre-training with synthetic data generated by the process-based model and the assimilation of remotely sensed GPP data**. The hierarchical structure and knowledge-guided loss functions also contribute to capturing complex carbon flux dynamics and the interpretability of predictions.
- The KGML-ag-Carbon framework has **potential for transferability to other applications**, such as predicting other nutrient cycles, estimating carbon outcomes over larger regions and in different ecosystems, and assessing the impacts of various management practices and extreme weather events. Its high computational efficiency compared to the underlying process-based model enables large-scale, high-resolution assessments.

We report that a data-driven deep learning Earth system emulator, FourCastNet, can predict global weather and generate medium-range forecasts five orders-of-magnitude faster than NWP while approaching state-of-the-art accuracy….

**Bullet points summary:**

- **FourCastNet, a data-driven deep learning Earth system emulator, can predict global weather and generate medium-range forecasts five orders of magnitude faster than traditional physics-based Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) while achieving comparable accuracy**. This significant acceleration is evident in its much quicker training time and inference speed.
- The model's performance is attributed to its **Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (AFNO) architecture**, which is adept at processing high-resolution data and demonstrates superior scaling properties compared to conventional vision transformers when applied to weather and climate data. FourCastNet employs techniques such as model and data parallelism, spectral convolution using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), and optimisations like CUDA graphs and JIT compilation to ensure efficient operation on supercomputing systems.
- **FourCastNet exhibits excellent scalability on large-scale supercomputing systems**, including Selene, Perlmutter, and JUWELS Booster, reaching up to 140.8 petaFLOPS. This scalability allows for faster training of larger models, considerably reducing the time-to-solution for weather forecasting. Furthermore, the rapid inference capability enables the generation of extensive ensemble forecasts, which could lead to improved predictions of rare and extreme weather events.
- The development of FourCastNet has profound **implications for weather and climate science**, offering potential solutions to key challenges such as the complexity, resolution, ensemble size, and throughput limitations inherent in traditional NWP methods. It opens up possibilities for emulating the entire Earth system, resolving fine-scale processes, and producing predictions at unprecedented speeds, which can help alleviate the "data avalanche" associated with exascale computing.
- FourCastNet signifies a step towards **"Interactivity at Scale" and the creation of digital twins of Earth**, empowering scientists, policymakers, and the wider society with the ability to access, interact with, and understand potential future climate scenarios. This advancement in weather and climate prediction can facilitate better-informed decision-making and further drive climate action.

This involves using kilometre-scale models alongside improved coarser-resolution hybrid ESMs that incorporate essential Earth system processes and feedbacks.
- This **AI-empowered multiscale approach** rests on four key pillars: **achieving higher resolution with new computing technologies, enhancing hybrid ESMs with physics-aware machine learning (ML), systematically using Earth observations to constrain and improve models, and establishing modern, operational science infrastructures**.
- The expected outcomes of this synergistic approach include **faster and more accurate delivery of policy-relevant climate information**, which is crucial for addressing urgent mitigation and adaptation needs in a rapidly changing world.
- The vision includes developing **hybrid ESMs where ML enhances the representation of subgrid-scale processes and Earth system feedbacks**, alongside the operationalisation of policy-relevant climate simulations and the creation of more realistic and interactive digital twins of the Earth system.
