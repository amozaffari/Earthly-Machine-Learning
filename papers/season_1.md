## Episode 1: GenCast- Probabilistic Weather Forecasting with Machine Learning

- **DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08252-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08252-9)

**Abstract:**  
Weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, so predicting the range of probable weather scenarios is crucial for important decisions, from warning the public about hazardous weather to planning renewable energy use. Traditionally, weather forecasts have been based on numerical weather prediction (NWP), which relies on physics-based simulations of the atmosphere. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based weather prediction (MLWP) have produced ML-based models with less forecast error than single NWP simulations. However, these advances have focused primarily on single, deterministic forecasts that fail to represent uncertainty and estimate risk...

## Episode xx: Advances in Land Surface Model-Based Forecasting

- **DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2081](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2081)

**Abstract:**
Most useful weather prediction for the public is near the surface. The processes that are most relevant for near-surface weather prediction are also those that are most interactive and exhibit positive feedback or have key role in energy partitioning. Land surface models (LSMs) consider these processes together with surface heterogeneity and forecast water, carbon and energy fluxes, and coupled with an atmospheric model provide boundary and initial conditions.
