## Episode 28:  **Artificial intelligence for modeling and understanding extreme weather and climate events**

- **DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-56573-8

**Abstract:**

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has deeply impacted various fields, including Earth system sciences, by improving weather forecasting, model emulation, parameter estimation, and the prediction of extreme events. The latter comes with specific challenges, such as developing accurate predictors from noisy, heterogeneous, small sample sizes and data with limited annotations. This paper reviews how AI is being used to analyze extreme climate events (like floods, droughts, wildfires, and heatwaves), highlighting the importance of creating accurate, transparent, and reliable AI models……

**Bullet points summary:**

- **Artificial intelligence (AI) is having a profound impact on Earth system sciences**, significantly enhancing capabilities for **modelling, detecting, forecasting, and assessing the impacts of extreme climate events** such as floods, droughts, wildfires, and heatwaves. AI also offers advances in attribution studies, explanation, and the generation of worst-case scenarios
- Despite its potential, **applying AI to extreme events faces significant challenges**. These include developing accurate predictors from noisy, heterogeneous, and small datasets, dealing with limited expert annotations, and overcoming the inherent difficulty of providing a precise, universally applicable statistical definition of an extreme event. Ensuring models capture complex, non-stationary relationships and perform robustly under unseen conditions are also key hurdles
- **Building trustworthy AI models is paramount** for high-stakes decisions related to public safety and resource allocation. This involves a focus on **transparency, reliability, and interpretability** through methods like Explainable AI (XAI), which helps to reveal model functioning, learned relationships, and biases, as well as causal inference to understand underlying mechanisms and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to assess prediction confidence
- The **"last mile" of AI integration focuses on operationalisation and effective risk communication** to translate AI-enhanced information into actionable insights for decision-makers and the public. This requires developing robust early warning systems, personalising alerts, and addressing ethical considerations such as fairness, privacy, and bias in AI models to ensure community preparedness and response
- **Cross-disciplinary collaboration is essential** for advancing AI applications in extreme event analysis. It necessitates a coordinated effort involving AI researchers, environmental and climate scientists, field experts, and policymakers to develop practical, understandable, and trustworthy AI solutions that are adapted to real-world needs and constraints, ultimately enhancing disaster readiness and risk reduction
